/// An async service which discard all the incoming bytes,

/// This service is often used when accepting TCP or UDP
/// services on port `9`, as an implementation of [RFC 863].
///
/// [RFC 863]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc863
///
/// ## TCP Based Discard Service
///
/// One discard service is defined as a connection based application on
/// TCP. A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port `9`. Once a
/// connection is established any data received is thrown away. No
/// response is sent. This continues until the calling user terminates
/// the connection.
///
/// ## UDP Based Discard Service
///
/// Another discard service is defined as a datagram based application on
/// UDP. A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port `9`. When a
/// datagram is received, it is thrown away. No response is sent.
