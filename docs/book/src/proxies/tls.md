        A TLS termination proxy is a proxy server that acts as an intermediary point between client and server applications, and is used to terminate and/or establish TLS (or DTLS) tunnels by decrypting and/or encrypting communications. This is different to TLS pass-through proxies that forward encrypted (D)TLS traffic between clients and servers without terminating the tunnel.

[Examples](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples):

- [/examples/tls_rustls_termination.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/tree/main/examples/tls_rustls_termination.rs):
  Spawns a mini handmade http server, as well as a TLS termination proxy, forwarding the
  plain text stream to the first.
- [/examples/mtls_tunnel_and_service.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/mtls_tunnel_and_service.rs):
  Example of how to do mTLS (mutual TLS, where the client also needs a certificate) using rama,
  as well as how one might use this concept to provide a tunnel service build with these concepts;

## Description

<div class="book-article-image-center">

```dot process
digraph {
    pad=0.2;
    "client" -> "proxy (rama)" [dir=both; label="  https"]
    "proxy (rama)" -> "server A" [dir=both; label="  http"]
    "proxy (rama)" -> "server B" [dir=both; label="  http"]
}
```

[Reverse proxies](./reverse.md) are a superset of proxies that also
include TLS Termination Proxies. It's very common for a reverse proxy
to also terminate the TLS tunnel.

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), defined in
[RFC 6797](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6797),
lets a website declare that it must only be accessed over HTTPS.
A server does this by sending a
[`Strict-Transport-Security` response header](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/headers/struct.StrictTransportSecurity.html)
over a secure connection.

nce a browser (user agent) receives this header,
it marks the host as an HSTS host and automatically enforces
HTTPS for future requestsâ€”refusing to load the site over plain HTTP or
when certificate errors occur. This protects users against downgrade attacks
and cookie hijacking over insecure connections.

Flow of operation:
1. The client first connects via HTTPS.
2. The server responds with `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=â€¦ [; includeSubDomains]`.
3. The browser caches this rule for the `max-age` duration.
4. All future HTTP requests to that host (and optionally its subdomains) are upgraded to HTTPS automatically.
5. If a TLS or certificate error occurs, the connection is aborted without user override.

This ensures that, after the first secure visit, the browser always enforces secure transport for that domain.

This is usually also coupled with
[an http-to-https redirect](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/service/redirect/struct.RedirectHttpToHttps.html)
to ensure clients that connect via insecure http do still land
on the same resource but over a secure connection instead.
